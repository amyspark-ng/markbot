import { MarkCommand } from "../types/command.ts";

const cmd: MarkCommand = {
    name: "hi",
    description: "say hi",
    options: [
        {
            name: "user",
            description: "User for say hi",
            type: "USER",
            required: false,
        },
    ],
    exe: (interaction) => {
        // epic things
    },
};

export default cmd;
```

Your new command is automatically loaded by `mod.ts`.
